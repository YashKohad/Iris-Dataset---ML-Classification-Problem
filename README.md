## Introduction

Iris flower can be divided into 3 species as per the length and width of their Sepals and Petals:

1) Iris Setosa
2) Iris Versicolour
3) Iris Virginica

We have a classification problem in which we need to predict the species of the Iris flower given the sizes of it's Sepals and petals.



## Conclusions

Our dataset was not very large and consisted of only 150 rows, with all the 3 species uniformly distributed.

PetalWidthCm was highly correlated with PetalLengthCm

PetalLengthCm was highly correlated with PetalWidthCm

We tried with 5 different machine learning Classification models on the Iris Test data set to classify the flower into it's three species:
a) Iris Setosa
b) Iris Versicolour
c) Iris Virginica<br>

based on the length and width of the flower's Petals and Sepals.
We got very high accuracy score for all the models, and even the accuracy score of 100 for KNN and SVM with Linear Kernel models with some hyper parameter tuning maybe due to small size of dataset.
